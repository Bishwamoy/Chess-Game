# Chess-Game
#AI Chess Game with GUI, Sounds & CPU/GPU Evaluation
#This is a full-featured Python Chess Game built using Tkinter, PyTorch, and pygame. It supports player vs player, player vs AI, and AI vs AI modes â€” complete with sounds, Unicode piece visuals, countdown clock, and #real-time CPU/GPU evaluation benchmark scores.

#ðŸ§  Features
#âœ… Tkinter-based graphical chess board with Unicode symbols

#âœ… Three modes: Player vs Player, Player vs AI, AI vs AI

#âœ… AI Engine using PyTorch for move evaluation

#âœ… Evaluation benchmarks for CPU and GPU shown after every move

#âœ… ðŸŽµ Sound effects: move, capture, countdown tick

#âœ… â™• Pawn promotion

#âœ… Fancy move logging (e.g., â™ž to f6)

#âœ… Clean architecture & fully extensible
